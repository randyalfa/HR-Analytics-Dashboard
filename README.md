# HR Analytics Dashboard
In this project, I analyzed a dummy HR dataset designed to reflect real-world HR scenarios. Using Microsoft Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights such as attrition rate, department-wise turnover, employee age and gender distribution, education field attrition, and job satisfaction levels. This helps in understanding employees trends and supports data-driven HR decisions.
